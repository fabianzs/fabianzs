It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.
You are not your job, you're not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You are not your fucking khakis. You are all singing, all dancing crap of the world.
At the time, my life just seemed too complete, and maybe we have to break everything to make something better out of ourselves.
The first step to eternal life is you have to die.
If I could wake up in a different place, at a different time, could I wake up as a different person?
Maybe self-improvement isn't the answer, maybe self-destruction is the answer.
